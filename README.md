# Comparing Solvers for Linear Programming Problems

This project deals with comparision between different solvers for the following linear programming problems:
- Assignment Problem
- Transportation Problem
- Knapsack Problem
- Traveling Salesman Problem
The chosen solvers are from the following packages:
- Gurobi
- SciPy
- OR-Tools
- PuLP
- CVXOPT
Solving time of the solvers are measured to compare the performance of different solvers for each linear programming problem.
